# 👋 Hi, I'm Antoniuk Oleksandr

I'm a backend-focused fullstack developer passionate about building fast, scalable, and reliable web applications. I enjoy working with **Go (Golang)** and **Svelte**, and I’m constantly exploring new technologies that help deliver better user and developer experiences.

## 🚀 Tech I Work With

### 🧠 Languages & Frameworks:
- **Go** (with [Fiber](https://gofiber.io/)) – for building fast and lightweight microservices
- **Node.js** (with Express & NestJS) – REST APIs and full-stack apps
- **React** & **Svelte** – frontend development, UI logic, and SPAs

### 🛠️ Backend & Infrastructure:
- **Prisma ORM** – for elegant and type-safe database access
- **PostgreSQL** – my go-to relational DB
- **Redis** – for caching and background task support
- **Sentry** – for error monitoring and tracking

## 📦 What I'm Into

- Designing **modular backends** with clean architecture
- Building and learning about **microservices**
- Writing clean, maintainable, and testable code
- Exploring performance optimizations
- System design, cloud deployment, and real-world scalability

## 🧩 Currently Learning

I'm deepening my skills in:
- **Microservice architecture** and communication patterns
- **Go concurrency & performance profiling**
- **CI/CD pipelines** and production observability
